Problem displaying initialisers in HTMLLayout
Whenever a stack trace is captured that involves either a static initialiser or 
a constructor, the JVM prints out the method name (either "init" or "clinit") 
and encapsulates less than and greater than tags around it.

However, the HTMLLayout doesn't convert the symbols to their HTML equivalent 
(can't remember what they are, sorry), so the method name is interpreted as a 
HTML tag (and thus not shown up).
