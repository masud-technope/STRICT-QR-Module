This enhancement extends the existing abbreviation option on the logger and
class conversion patterns.
log4j 1.2 supported the following abbreviation patterns.
"%c"  - Full logger name
"%c{2}" - Right-most two elements of logger name
The enhancement adds the following:
"%c{1.}" - replace non-terminal elements with first character only
"%c{1~.}" - replace non-terminal with first character and use ~ to mark
abbreviation.
"%c{1.*.3.}" - (example of stacking) replace first element with first character,
use full second element, following non-terminate elements with first 3 characters.
